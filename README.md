# Booking.com Scraper

## Overview

This web scraper is specifically designed to crawl Booking.com, a website equipped with bot detection mechanisms. Due to the challenges posed by bot detection, the scraper utilizes proxy servers, which can incur significant costs when crawling a large number of hotels. However, this approach allows for the extraction of highly detailed information about hotels, including available rooms, prices, and more.

### Use Case

The ideal use case for this scraper involves setting precise filters to target specific types of accommodations. For example, you can narrow down the search to apartments close to the city center with parking facilities and a kitchen. This focused approach helps manage costs and allows for the extraction of valuable information. For instance, it enables the detection of pricing policies for different suites and identifies whether a room was sold or remained available at a particular price point. This level of granularity empowers users to make informed decisions, such as finding the best price for a particular suite.

### Proxy Considerations

Given the sophisticated bot detection mechanisms employed by Booking.com, the scraper's reliance on proxy servers becomes crucial. These proxies help mitigate the risk of being detected as a bot, enabling the scraper to navigate through multiple pages and gather detailed information.

### Scraper Variants

This scraper has a counterpart that utilizes the [Booking.com Python API Spider](https://github.com/avkaz/Booking.com-python-api-spider). The API scraper doesn't require the use of proxies and is suitable for handling massive datasets. However, it comes with a trade-off in terms of information granularity. Unlike the web scraper, the API scraper provides the lowest price for a hotel but lacks the ability to retrieve detailed pricing information for each room.
